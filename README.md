# Computational Analysis of Transcriptional Regulation by the MOV10 Protein
**Project Status:** Completed

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project focused on analyzing the **transcriptional effects of MOV10**, an RNA helicase linked to microRNA-mediated regulation. Using public bulk RNA-seq data (**BioProject: PRJNA217781**), the goal was to understand how **MOV10 knockdown (KD)** and **overexpression (OE)** affect gene expression in HEK293F cells.

The workflow included preprocessing (QC, trimming, alignment), differential expression analysis, and multiple visualizations (**volcano plots, heatmap, Venn & UpSet diagrams**).

**Key outcomes:**
- **239 DEGs after KD**, **338 DEGs after OE**, only **41 shared genes** (8% overlap)
- **KD** caused stronger, broader changes than OE
- KD and OE induce **distinct and sometimes opposite transcriptional programs**

## 2. Background and Rationale

### Why This Project?

MOV10 interacts with FMRP and the microRNA pathway, acting as both a facilitator and antagonist. By re-analyzing a public dataset, this project computationally explores MOV10’s **bidirectional regulatory role**.

### Dataset Information

- **Samples:** MOV10 Knockdown, MOV10 Overexpression, Control (irrelevant siRNA)
- **Cell type:** HEK293F
- **Reference:** Kenny PJ et al., *Cell Reports* (2014), PMID: 25464849

## 4. Methodology: Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing

1. **SRA Download:** Raw FASTQ files retrieved via SRA Toolkit
2. **QC:** Assessed in FastQC
3. **Trimming:** Cleaned with Trimmomatic
4. **Alignment:** HISAT2 to reference genome
5. **Quantification:** Counts generated by Subread/featureCounts

### Phase 2: Differential Expression Analysis

1. **Input:** count matrix into DESeq2
2. **Experimental Design:** Three conditions (Control, KD, OE)
3. **Filtering/Normalization:** Remove low-count genes, normalize, apply variance-stabilizing transformation
4. **DEA:** DESeq2 to compare KD vs Control, OE vs Control
5. **Result Shrinkage:** lfcShrink (apeglm) for fold change estimates

### Phase 3: Visualization & Comparison

- **Volcano Plot:** Significant DEGs for KD and OE (EnhancedVolcano)
- **Heatmap:** Union of significant genes, Z-score scaled, hierarchical clustering (pheatmap)
- **Venn Diagram & UpSet Plot:** Overlap analysis (41 shared DEGs)

## 5. Results and Analysis

### Differential Expression

- **MOV10 Knockdown (KD):** 239 DEGs; upregulation dominant (possible repression relief)
- **MOV10 Overexpression (OE):** 338 DEGs; fewer and subtler than KD
- **Shared DEGs:** Only 41 genes (8% overlap) between KD and OE

### Visualizations

- **Volcano Plots:** KD shows stronger significance, OE more subtle
- **Heatmap:** KD, OE, and control cluster distinctly; controls between KD/OE; many genes regulated oppositely in KD vs OE
- **Venn & UpSet:** Majority of DEGs are condition-specific; UpSet plot quantifies overlap and exclusivity

---

## 6. Conclusion

The analysis reveals MOV10’s **dual regulatory role**:
- **Knockdown:** Robust changes, many genes upregulated
- **Overexpression:** Fewer, tighter changes
- **Comparative:** Only 41 DEGs overlap (context-specific effect)

**Key takeaway:** MOV10 perturbation in either direction (KD or OE) causes distinct and frequently opposite gene expression changes, validating its central role in mRNA regulation.  
This pipeline is robust and reusable for other RNA-binding proteins or gene regulatory studies.
